## 👋 Hi there, I’m Jhonnes Toledo

I am a Data Science postgraduate professional with a strong academic background in Physics, holding both a BSc and an MSc from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF). This background has provided me with solid analytical thinking, quantitative modeling expertise, and a rigorous scientific approach to problem-solving.

I have experience in data analysis, statistics, and applied computational methods, working with tools such as Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn), SQL, and Jupyter environments. I am proficient in version control using Git and GitHub, as well as in managing reproducible environments with Conda.

My professional focus lies in Data Analysis and Data Science, with a particular interest in applying statistical methods and machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Additionally, I have experience teaching Physics and Mathematics, which has strengthened my communication skills and my ability to clearly explain complex concepts.

This GitHub profile serves as a professional portfolio, where I showcase projects, technical studies, and my continuous development in data science and analytics.
