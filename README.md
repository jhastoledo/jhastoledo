## 👋 Hi there, I’m Jhonnes Toledo

I am a Data Science postgraduate with a strong background in Physics (BSc & MSc – UFJF). I have experience in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, working with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), SQL, and Jupyter. I use Git and GitHub for version control and Conda for reproducible environments. This GitHub showcases my projects and continuous learning in data science.
